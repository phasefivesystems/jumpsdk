This sample implements an echoing virtual channel. Anything it receives on the virtual channel, it will echo back to the server.

To use this sample:

1. Build and run the app in XCode. 
2. While the app is running open up Jump Desktop for Mac and connect to a RDP computer (you must be running Jump Desktop for Mac 4.1 or later). 
3. Inside the RDP session build and run the Windows PingVirualChannel app.
